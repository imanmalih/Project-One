Project Title: Global Video Games Sales 
Team Members: A'Nayah, Ivan, Brittney
Project Description: This data set explores the various trends of marketable gaming consoles between the years of 1980-2020 in the North American, European, and Japanese regions. Our intent is to use this data set to help us determine the best genre, platform, and publisher to aid in the development of our game.


Research Questions: As game producers, we want to learn what are the most popular game genre, trends, and publishers, per region, in order to create a game that will be profitable.

Q:What genre of games are the most preferred in each region?

Q:How has the sales changed over the years per region?

Q: If I wanted to create a game in each region, which platform should I use? 

Q: Who are the top ten publishers per region?

Rough Breakdown Of the Tasks: Data Cleaning. Data Visualization. Written Analysis. Presentation.

# Data Analysis

Based on the provided data on video games, we conclude the top sales by genre for North America and Europe are action, sports, and shooter. For Japan, the top three sales based on genre are role-playing, action, and sports.
The highest profitable sales peak were between the years 2005 through 2010 for all three regions.
Shortly after the sales decreased drastically, we assume it's because of the new way of getting games digitally and access to more used games.
We conclude if a game is produced, for the NA Region the top three platforms are X360, PS2, and Wii. For the EU region, it's PS3,PS2,X360. For the JP region, the top three are DS,PS,PS2. 
The top publisher for all three regions is Nintendo.
