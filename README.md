# Analysis
    1. What genre of games are the most preferred in each region?

    2. How has the sales changed over the years per region?
    
    - The highest profitable sales peak were between the years 2005 through 2010 for all three regions. Shortly after the sales decreased drastically, we predict        it is because of the new way of getting games digitally and access to more used games.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, if you want to sell a game in  North America or Europe, it is best to cater to the Action genre for any major consoles. Whereas in Japan, a game catered to Role-playing would be ideal. In selection of a platform, X360 or any version of the PS, would be most profitable  across all three regions. Nintendo is the highest selling publisher across all three regions, more so in Japan, however Electronic Arts is also a beneficial publisher in the North American and European regions.
