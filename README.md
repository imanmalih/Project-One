Project Title: Global Video Games Sales 
Team Members: A'Nayah, Ivan, Brittney
Project Description: This dataset, sourced from vgchartz.com, offers a wealth of insights into the dynamics between platform and genre for the top 100 video games worldwide. Observe which platforms are driving global sales, what genres have been most successful in different regions across the world, and how both of these factors have changed over time. Analyze this data to inform your understanding of the gaming industry and discover trends propelling game developers to success!

Research Questions: As game producers, we want to learn what are the most popular game genre, trends, and publishers, per region, in order to create a game that will be profitable.

Q:What genre of games are the most preferred in each region?

# Data Analysis

Based on the provided data on video games, we conclude the top sales by genre for North America and Europe are action, sports, and shooter. For Japan, the top three sales based on genre are role-playing, action, and sports.
The highest profitable sales peak were between the years 2005 through 2010 for all three regions.
Shortly after the sales decreased drastically, we assume it's because of the new way of getting games digitally and access to more used games.
We conclude if a game is produced, for the NA Region the top three platforms are X360, PS2, and Wii. For the EU region, it's PS3,PS2,X360. For the JP region, the top three are DS,PS,PS2. 
The top publisher for all three regions is Nintendo.
